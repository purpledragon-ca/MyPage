## Overview

This project follows the open-source repository [YOLOv8-Mobile](https://github.com/xforcevesa/YOLOv8-Mobile), adapting its pipeline to run YOLOv8 object detection on a mobile device.  
The main goal is to deploy a compact, real-time detector on phone hardware with minimal custom modification beyond the original tutorial.
